Download hadoop from    -->>>  http://mirrors.estointernet.in/apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.7/      --->>  hadoop-2.7.7.tar.gz 
(from mirror site)

Unpack the downloaded Hadoop distribution. 
In the extracted distribution, edit the file etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh to define some parameters as follows:

a)  first of all find your java path
              readlink -f /usr/bin/java | sed "s:bin/java::"   ====>> results like this ==>> /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
==>> so go to under that directory and copy all things and paste it under  /usr/java/latest..

==>> if you have not any directory for paste create new one.

b) Now change line in .sh file:
             export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/latest
             
             
c) bin/hadoop
